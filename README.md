# Banh mi for Bambi (BfB)

#![alt text](http://i64.tinypic.com/2cnwqdx.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Often we end up with leftover food that we cannot discard in an environmentally conscious and efficent manner.

BfB is a tinder-like app that aims to solve food waste/hunger problems by letting people easily broadcast that their food is about to be trashed if not eaten soon. By making it easier for hungry people to discover potential sources of food (leftover pizza/chinese food from club meetings, etc), we hope to both reduce food waste and alleviate hunger at the same time.

Developed at Facebook Hack for a Cause Seattle 2016.
